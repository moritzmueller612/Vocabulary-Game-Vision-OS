This repository contains three versions of the Vocabulary VisionOS App, each corresponding to a different interaction method for switching between learning and game modes.

ðŸ“‚ Vocabulary_VisionOSApp (Version C)

This version implements both interaction methods from Version A and Version B.
	â€¢	The game mode is positioned behind the vocabulary list, utilizing the backside of the window for a seamless transition.
	â€¢	Users can switch modes by either turning around 180Â° or stepping forward.
	â€¢	Returning to the vocabulary list works by either stepping back or turning around again.

ðŸ“‚ Vocabulary_VisionOSApp2 (Version B)

This version features a spatial transition:
	â€¢	The game mode is located in a separate window behind the vocabulary list.
	â€¢	Users physically walk through the list to enter the game mode.
	â€¢	Stepping back returns them to the vocabulary list.

ðŸ“‚ Vocabulary_VisionOSApp3 (Version A)

This version uses a rotation-based transition:
	â€¢	The game mode is activated by turning 180Â° around oneâ€™s axis.
	â€¢	Turning back brings the user back to the vocabulary list.
